- ## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Nmap
- Whois
- Shodan
- Nmap
- Recon-ng
- Google Dorks

- ## 🔍 Methodology
The reconnaissance phase involved passive and active techniques, such as:
- DNS enumeration
- WHOIS lookups
- Network scanning
- Web metadata analysis
- Social media intelligence gathering
Each method was carefully selected to reflect real-world threat assessments.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required tools using the script or manual setup.
3. Navigate to the `/demo` folder for showcase scripts and sample targets.
4. Run `python demo_scan.py` to see basic recon in action.

5. ## 🎥 Demonstration
A sample scan was conducted on a test environment to show enumeration techniques. Results include open ports, service banners, and discovered subdomains.

## 🧠 Conclusions
This showcase emphasized the power of reconnaissance as the first step in understanding a target system. Ethical hackers must master these tools to prepare for deeper security assessments.
